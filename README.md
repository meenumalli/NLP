Personal Project: Classifying Amazon Foods reviews as positive or negative

Objective: To develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques that accurately classifies Amazon Foods reviews as either positive or negative.

Data Source: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consisted of Amazon Foods reviews.

Approach: The project involved several procedures such as data cleaning, NLP preprocessing, text to numeric conversion, normalization, and ML modeling. I used Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn to implement these procedures. Then employed NLP techniques such as vectorizing, stemming, and lemmatization to preprocess the textual data before converting it into numeric form. Then normalized the data and applied machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model.

Results: The final model achieved an AUC score of 89%, indicating that it is performing well in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. 

Conclusion: This personal project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets and apply appropriate techniques to achieve the desired outcome. It demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, NLP preprocessing, text to numeric conversion, normalization, and machine learning modeling. The development of the predictive model indicates my ability to solve complex problems and deliver valuable insights.
